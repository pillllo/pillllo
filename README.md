### Hi there 👋 🙋‍♀️

I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer who's played around with React, Tailwind, NodeJS, Express, Postgres, MongoDB and a bunch of other technologies.

### I'm currently working on:
MenteeMatch - a web app built for the [Dare IT Mentoring Program](https://mentoring.dareit.io/), which helps women find their first job in tech. The app supports the the matching of mentors and mentees, facilitating the process of creating 150+ mentor-mentee pairs out of 1k applications.

Check out the MenteeMatch app [here](https://github.com/pillllo/mentee-match)

Please do reach out if you'd like to get involved with Dare IT, or just have a tech friendly chat.
